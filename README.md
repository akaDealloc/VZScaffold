VZScaffold
=============

VZScaffold is an Objective-C code generator for Vizzle:https://github.com/Vizzle/Vizzle

The idea was borrowed from Ruby on Rails.

`ruby vz_scaffold.rb MainPage`

if the "MainPage" is list view , just add `-l` as the last param:

`ruby vz_scaffold.rb MainPage -l`

You are ready to go now
